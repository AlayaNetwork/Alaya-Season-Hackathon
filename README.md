## Introduction

[Alaya](https://www.alaya.network/en) is a global distributed financial infrastructure and a pilot zone for PlatON, a distributed privacy-preserving AI network. By combining blockchain and privacy-preserving computation capabilities, it provides developers with a safe, high-performance, and scalable distributed financial application "sandbox" and testing ground.

This Hackathon is jointly organized by the LatticeX Foundation and DoraHacks. It aims to encourage developers to engage in various development practices based on the **Alaya Development Testnet**, improve infrastructure, and explore innovative technologies and applications. 

Just with access to the Internet, you can participate in the global Hackathon! The Hackathon will set no specific contest subjects, but welcomes all projects built/integrated based on the Alaya network. To get more inspirations, take a look at [Hackathon Idea List](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork/Alaya-Season-Hackathon/blob/main/Alaya_Season_Hackatho_Project_Ideas.md).

During the Hackathon, live lectures, workshops and group discussions on various topics will be held from time to time. Welcome to join the Hackathon [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/neSjeUIee8U4ZjA1) group chat to find teammates and technical support.
